# CS1301 Google Homepage! + Profile Page
 Created: Feb 2022 | My first website & first time coding in HTML & CSS! The goal was to create a replica of the google homepage but replacing it with elements from our Computer Science course. After pressing the profile button, the user is taken to a personal page that includes some of my favorite things.
